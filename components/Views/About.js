      This project was if anything, inspired by my family's habit of dinner and
      cards most weekends, though the games we played were substantially more
      Bullshit inclined. Literally, thats the name of the most common game!

      I personally am currently going through Savvy Coders at the moment, I got
      interested in coding after I started spending more and more of my life
      exploring computers and the internet. Born in Portland Oregon, now living
      in Saint Louis, I hope that I'll be able to achieve my goals and develop
      even more interesting and indepth projects than this!
